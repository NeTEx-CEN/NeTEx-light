# NeTEx-light

The normative NeTEx schema could be considered very big and extensive.
Code generation tools for C# have difficulties with processing it.
In order to use NeTEx within C# this derived XSD was created.
This schema should be used informative, for application development, but not for validation purposes.
This schema has been reduced to only match the scope of the EPIP Profile (European Passengenger Inforamtion Profile) but remains compliant with the main NeTEx Schema
